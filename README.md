Extracting meetup data and analyzing using machine learning algorithms

Prediction of categories that interests more members.

This paper addresses the problem associated with predicting the categories that eventuate the members learning from their previous attendance. The data is gathered from Meetup, a social networking platform which consists of vast historical data using which we can build a recommender system using machine learning algorithms which learns the features of the members, which helps in understanding the interests of attendees of the events based on their previous attendance for various events or groups. This eventuates a recommender system by application of different models such as support vector machine, random forest, KNN and Na√Øve Bayes and yet found random forest as our champion model which boosts the high-level accuracy.
